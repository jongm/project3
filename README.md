# Income Classifier

## Model Details
This is a Random Forest Classifier from Scikit Learn created by Jon Garcia for the final project of the third course of the MLOps nanodegree at Udacity. 

## Requirements
This project is expected to work under Python 3.8. All required libraries are listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file.
The datasets for training or inference, as well as the current working model and econders, have to be obtained by running ``dvc pull`` with the given dvc configuration.

## Deployment
The inference API can be launched by Uvicorn or Unicorn using the ``app`` object in ``main.py``
